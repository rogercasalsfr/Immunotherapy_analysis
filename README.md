**Master thesis**

This project's goal is to identify immune cell trajectories and gene regulatory networks in a tumour microenvironment. Its performance is being evaluated. Another goal is to find genes that are differentially expressed in order to characterise the trajectories and perform enrichment analysis.

Data was extracted from the GSE123813 repository. Only SCC patients samples were used.

Folder containing code: It includes the preprocessing steps used in the Seurat workflow. Dynverse and Monocle3 inference trajectory methods are compared. ClusterProfiler (included in the Monocle3 files) is used for enrichment analysis.
